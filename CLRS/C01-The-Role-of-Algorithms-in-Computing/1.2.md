### Exercises 1.2-2
***
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?8n^2)
 steps, while merge sort runs in ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?64nlg{n})
 steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

### `Answer`
解方程 ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?8n^2=64nlg{n})

for 2 < n < 43


### Exercises 1.2-3
***
What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?100n^2) runs faster
than an algorithm whose running time is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^n) on the same machine?

### `Answer`
还是解方程 ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?100n^2=2^n)

for n = 15
