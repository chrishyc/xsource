### Exercises 8.3-2
***
Which of the following sorting algorithms are stable: insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort? Give a simple scheme that makes any sorting algorithm stable. How much additional time and space does your scheme entail?

### `Answer`

* stable: insertion sort, merge sort
* not stable: heapsort, quicksort

给每个item都增加一个原始index属性，最后相同的元素根据index再排一次.需要O(n)的额外空间.


### Exercises 8.3-3
***
Use induction to prove that radix sort works. Where does your proof need the assumption that the intermediate sort is stable?

### `Answer`
循环不变式:每次**for**循环前，最后的**i-1**个数字是排好序的.

Initialization:循环还没开始，0个数字，是排好的.

Maintenance:排第i个数字时，如果数字不相同，那肯定是排号序的，如果相同，因为采用stable的COUNTTING-SORT算法，后面的i-1位是排好序的，所以能保持性质.

Termination:最后是排好序的.

### Exercises 8.3-4
***
Show how to sort n integers in the range 0 to n^2 - 1 in O(n) time.

Note: In 3rd Edition, the number range is 0 to n^3 - 1, the basic idea is same
### `Answer`
将这些数字看成n进制，使用radix-sort.

The running time is O(4n) = O(n)

The radix sort running time is O(d * (n + k)) , where d is the number of digit, n is the number of elements, and k is the number of possible values.

In this case, k equals n. So the total running time is O(2 * (n + n)) = O(4n) = O(n)

Naive Implementation with a lot of copy: [implementation](./exercise_code/radixSort.cpp)

### Exercises 8.3-5
***
In the first card-sorting algorithm in this section, exactly how many sorting passes are needed to sort d-digit decimal numbers in the worst case? How many piles of cards would an operator need to keep track of in the worst case?

### `Answer`
从最高位往后面排序不是一种好办法，需要递归去做. 需要k^d次. 要同时care nk堆数据.
