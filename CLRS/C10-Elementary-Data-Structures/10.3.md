### Exercises 10.3-2
***
Write the procedures ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT for a homogeneous collection of objects implemented by the single-array representation.

### `Answer`
[implementation](./exercise_code/af-obj.c)

### Exercises 10.3-3
***
Why don't we need to set or reset the prev fields of objects in the implementation of the ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT procedures?

### `Answer`

因为这类似于一个栈，没有prev.

### Exercises 10.3-4
***
It is often desirable to keep all elements of a doubly linked list compact in storage, using, for example, the first m index locations in the multiple-array representation. (This is the case in a paged, virtual-memory computing environment.) Explain how the procedures ALLOCATE>- OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT can be implemented so that the representation is compact. Assume that there are no pointers to elements of the linked list outside the list itself. (Hint: Use the array implementation of a stack.)


### `Answer`

* ALLOCATE:选free_list的head.
* FREE-OBJECT:不是直接变成head,而是按sorted的方式插入.

这样可以保证每次分配的时候取排在最前面的空位置



### Exercises 10.3-5
***
Let L be a doubly linked list of length m stored in arrays key, prev, and next of length n. Suppose that these arrays are managed by ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT procedures that keep a doubly linked free list F. Suppose further that of the n items, exactly m are on list L and n-m are on the free list. Write a procedure COMPACTIFY-LIST(L, F) that, given the list L and the free list F, moves the items in L so that they occupy array positions 1, 2,..., m and adjusts the free list F so that it remains correct, occupying array positions m + 1, m + 2,..., n. The running time of your procedure should be Θ(n), and it should use only a constant amount of extra space. Give a careful argument for the correctness of your procedure.

### `Answer`

* 先遍历free_list,给每个item的prev标记一下，用来区别L中的item.
* 两根指针，一根p1在array的头，另一个p2在尾巴.p1向右移动知道遇到free item,p2向左移动直到遇到used item,然后交换p1和p2的内容.遍历一直到p1,p2遇到为止.
* 重新整理free_list中的元素.
