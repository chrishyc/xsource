### Exercises 12.1-2
***
What is the difference between the binary-search-tree property and the min-heap property (see page 129)? Can the min-heap property be used to print out the keys of an n-node tree in sorted order in O(n) time? Explain how or why not.

### `Answer`
做不到,因为基于比较的排序的上限是nlgn。堆排序建堆时间是 O(n), 但是每次 拿出去后要用 lg n 的时间去调整。

It is impossible. Because the lower bound based on comparision is nlgn. Although it takes O(n) to build a heap. But each time we take the top, we have to adjust the heap whcih takes O(lgn) time.


### Exercises 12.1-3
***
Give a nonrecursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk. (Hint: There is an easy solution that uses a stack as an auxiliary data structure and a more complicated but elegant solution that uses no stack but assumes that two point- ers can be tested for equality.)

### Exercises 12.1-5
***
Argue that since sorting n elements takes Ω(nlgn) time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of n elements takes Ω(nlgn) time in the worst case.

### `Answer`
如果下界不是nlgn, 就会产生矛盾。我们之前知道可以用 O(n) 的时间按序遍历输 出 BST 中的元素,如果基于比较的 BST 构造下界不是 n lg n, 那我们就可以利用这 个方法产生基于比较的速度优于 n lg n 的排序算法,矛盾.

If it is not O(nlgn), we can find a conflict. We know it takes O(n) time to inorder print elements in a BST. If the lower bound in the worst case in the comparison model is better than O(nlgn), then we can utilize this to give a better algorithm.
