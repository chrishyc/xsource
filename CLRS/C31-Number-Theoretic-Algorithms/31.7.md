### Exercises 31.7-1
***

Consider an RSA key set with `p = 11`, `q = 29`, `n = 319`, and `e = 3`. What
value of `d` should be used in the secret key? What is the encryption of the message `M = 100`?

### `Answer`

We follow the procedure of RSA cryptosystem.

1. `n = pq = 319`
2. `phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 280`
3. For fixed `e = 3`, apply Euclidean algorithm to find its inverse modulo `(p-1)(q-1)`. We find `1 = 280 - 3 x 93` and the inverse of `e` is `-93 mod 280 = 187`
4. Hence, `(e, n) = (3, 319)` is the public key and `(d, n) = (187, 319)` is the private key.
5. For `M = 100`, the cipher text is `100^3 mod 319 = 254`.
