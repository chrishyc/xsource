upgrade.sis.isFinished.ise=当 ServletInputStream 不处于非阻塞模式时调用 isFinished() 是非法的（即必须首先调用 setReadListener()）
upgrade.sis.read.ise=在非阻塞模式下调用任何read()方法而不首先通过调用isready()检查是否有可用的数据是非法的
upgrade.sis.readListener.set=在同一个upgraded连接上调用多次setReadListener()函数是非法的
upgrade.sos.writeListener.null=对setWriteListener()传递null是非法的
